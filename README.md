# 🚴‍♀️ Cyclistic Bike-Share Capstone Project

This is my Google Data Analytics Capstone project using Cyclistic bike-share data (June 2024–May 2025). I used **SQL (BigQuery)** for data cleaning and exploration, and **Tableau** for visual analytics.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- BigQuery SQL
- Excel (initial data observation)
- Tableau Public (visualizations)
- Medium (documentation and insights)

## 📊 Key Phases
- 📂 **Phase 1: Ask** – Define business problem
- 🔍 **Phase 2: Prepare** – Collect & combine 12 months of data
- 🧹 **Phase 3: Process** – Clean data in BigQuery using logic-based rules
- 📈 **Phase 4: Analyze** – Extract insights via SQL & Tableau
- 📌 **Phase 5: Share** – Create dashboards, write insights
- 🧠 **Phase 6: Act** – Recommend strategic actions based on insights

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Highlights
- Removed rides < 1 min or > 1 day
- Enforced required columns
- Applied bike-type-specific null rules
- Generated derived columns: ride duration, weekday, ride month, roundtrip flag

## 📉 Insights
- Casual riders prefer weekends & longer trips
- Members ride more during commute hours
- Seasonal trends impact casual usage
- Roundtrip behavior seen in scenic areas like Streeter Dr, Millennium Park

## 💡 Final Recommendations
- Weekend-only pass
- 3-month seasonal membership
- Roundtrip discounts at key stations
- Long-ride Flexi Pass
